# Given a highly transactional system build a aggregator system
# which can process high influx of the transactiond data
# as well as it should be able to aggregate the data for analytics
# There can be different templates of aggregation data 
# There can be a combination of static and dynamic data for aggregation
# We should also be able to incorporate a new set of templates with configurable data points for aggregation
# You are free to choose the DB and Caching infra of your choice. Pipeline can be also be another option.
# Lets build a system which can aggreagte the data and can be used by any internal system for aggreation.
