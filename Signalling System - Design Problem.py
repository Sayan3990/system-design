# Given Indian road system from Left to Right and RED-Orange-Green Signal on Traffic Signal Route
# If as per the US rule we change the signal system from Right to Left and Trafic Signal color code remains the same
# What all challenge be there in the Traffic Signal automated system
# Can you please DB design/ER Diagram the same and show an HLD to understand the architecture which can handle both the logic
# Let the Left to Right and Right to Left road system be the configuration
# Try to make it as generic and as real time as it can be. Thank You.
