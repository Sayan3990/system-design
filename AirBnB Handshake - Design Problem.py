## Consider GO-MMT shares hand with AirBnB and want to sell their inventory in Goibibo & MakeMyTrip.
 
## How can we sell the inventory at GO-MMT end but we should NOT share the customer details during booking push to AirBnB.
## How can we send a communication like “How to reach the property” which AirBnB sends to its customer, 
## We want to send the same via Goibibo or MakeMyTrip, how can we achieve this without sharing customer details while consuming same info from AirBnB.
## How can you handle the bulk event push to GO-MMT system with push notifications for daily customers?
## You are allowed to think both the approaches "PULL vs PUSH" as well you can request AirBnB to make some changes too
