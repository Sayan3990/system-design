# Design a system where OTAs like MMT, Booking, Expedia wants to run a Loyalty program for hoteliers
# This should benefit the hoteliers to enroll for a program and they should be able to increase repeated customers
# This should be extensible to any loyalty mode for eg. credit card, club membership or hotel special beenefits etc.
# Customers should be able to see the benefits on the top of the funnel 
# Hotel Supply should be able to configure them from backend by targeting certain segments of the customers
# Every time customer books a hotel inventory he/she should be able to maintain a history of loyalty points
# There should be a band of loyalty program also and it should be configurable for eg. 
#   5 trips - Silver Band
#   10 trips - Gold Band
#   25 trips - Diamond Band 
#   50 trips - Platinum Band etc
