## Step 1: Constraints and use cases
## How many cabs are there in the country/state/possibly in one city?
## How many customers look for the cabs at a same time?
## How many requests our database can take - IOPS?
## How many requests the given API can take - RPM?
## Can we store pincodes or number plates in our databse?
## What all attributes I can save for a cab in my database?
## What all information is required to book a cab?

## Step 2: Abstract design (High Level Design)
## TODO

## Step 3: Understanding bottlenecks
## Can I make 10000 lat long comparison using the same API?
## Is my database capable of taking so many requests for so many customers at a same time?
##   

## Step 4: Scaling your abstract design (Low Level Design)
