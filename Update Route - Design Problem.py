## Problem Solving & System Design
 
## Design a solution where a GO-MMT Cars/Bike traveller who is travelling between A-B (source-destination) 
## founds a roadblock/pothole/construction work due to which the journey needs to change the direction, 
## how can the driver update GO-MMT app about the blocker on the route and 
# how can GO-MMT notify rest of the customers who is also planning to travel via the same blocker route on the very same day.

# How to save Route information with blocker 
# How to find other travellers in the same route
# How to suggest the alternate route
# How to fecth and notify other customers
# How to scale the Notification queue if there are 50K incidents happen in a worst case scenario?
