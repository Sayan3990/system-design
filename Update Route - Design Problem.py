## Problem Solving & System Design
 
## I asked him to design a solution where a GO-MMT Cars/Bike traveller who is travelling between A-B (source-destination) 
## founds a roadblock/pothole/construction work due to which the traveller needs to change the direction, 
## how can he update GO-MMT app and notify rest of the customers who is also planning to travel the same A-B route on the very same day.

# How to save Route information
# How to find other travellers in the same route
# How to notify other customers
# How to suggest the alternate route
# How to scale the Notification queue if there are 50K incidents happen in a worst case scenario?
